=======================

This should be the most colorful section of our guide. Yes, we are going to deal with colors and background of HTML documents.

Colors in CSS
-------------
CSS provides the flexibility of representing colors in 3 different ways. You can chose to specify a color either in one of the standard formats mentioned below.

 1. Standard color name : *green*
 2. HEX : *#00ff00*
 3. RGB (Red, Green, Blue) : *rgb(0,255,0)*
 4. RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) : *rgba(0,255,0,0.3)*
 5. HSL (Hue , Saturation, Lightness) : *hsl(120,100%,75%)*
 6. HSLA (Hue , Saturation, Lightness, Alpha) : *hsla(120,100%,75%,0.3)*

> **NOTE:**
>
> - RGB mode is hardware-oriented.
> - HSL color mode depends on the lightness and darkness composition which may be considered as a advantage over RGB scheme.
