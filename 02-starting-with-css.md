Let's now start with the basic usage of CSS in our HTML files. You need to understand that CSS can't exists without HTML. They are made for each other :) Said that, we have to place our CSS styles in the HTML file. Based on where we place those CSS code, we can have 3 different ways of using CSS, which are listed below.

 1. Inline CSS 
 2. Internal CSS 
 3. External CSS

There are some advantages for using external CSS files because of the following reasons.

 - Page load performance will be better if browsers can cache them.
 - It's very easy for development, maintenance and re-usability. 
 - HTML and styling are separated fully according to general web standards.

In some cases, using inline CSS styles is much appropriate. For example, if you want just to style a single element, there is no point of creating a .css external file. So consider other methods of using CSS based on your requirement and styling complexity.
