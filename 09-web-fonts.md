CSS Web Fonts
=============

Are you bored of the fonts like *Times New Roman, Sans Serif and Arial*? In general, fonts are limited to the set of fonts installed on your computers or other devices. To make your website stand out, you can use your own fonts in your website. Looks existing? Yes, we have now *"Web Fonts"*.

CSS Web Fonts is a new feature in CSS3. It was proposed in the era of CSS2 but without much popularity, but gained momentum only with CSS3 and introduction of modern browsers.

With CSS3, you can get the help of @font-face to define your own custom fonts on the web pages.

> **NOTE:** CSS Web Fonts is not yet matured and might have changes in future CSS specifications and how browsers renders them.
